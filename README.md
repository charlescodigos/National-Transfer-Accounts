# National-Transfer-Accounts

This repository provides datasets of National Transfer Accounts (NTA) for Brazil derived from two academic articles, each rigorously following the United Nations 2013 NTA Manual guidelines. These results are aligned with Brazil's National Accounts statistics from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), ensuring consistency between the two frameworks.

## Contents

**Figures**: Formal charts and table used in the articles.

**NTA2018_Brasil_Educ.xlsx**: Spreadsheets containing detailed NTA data across age groups (0-90+) and educational levels (total, primary, secondary, post-secondary) in 2018.

**Auxiliary.xlsx**: Auxiliary tables for macro controls estimation between 2003 and 2018, including "SNA Other current transfers", "Other current transfers excluding current transfer within government and current international cooperation" and "Other current transfers excluding current transfers within government and current international cooperation".
