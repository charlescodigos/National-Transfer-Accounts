# National-Transfer-Accounts

This repository provides datasets of National Transfer Accounts (NTA) for Brazil derived from two academic articles, each rigorously following the United Nations 2013 NTA Manual guidelines. These results are aligned with Brazil's National Accounts statistics from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), ensuring consistency between the two frameworks.
